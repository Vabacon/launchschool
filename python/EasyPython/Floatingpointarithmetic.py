# Write a program that prompts the user for two positive numbers (floating-point),
# then prints the results of the following operations on those two numbers: addition,
# subtraction, product, quotient, floor quotient, remainder, and power.
# Do not worry about validating the input.

print(number_1 / number_2)
print(number_1 // number_2)
