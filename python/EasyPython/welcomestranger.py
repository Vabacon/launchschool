# Create a function that takes 2 arguments, a list and a dictionary. The list will contain 2 or more elements that,
# when joined with spaces, will produce a person's name. The dictionary will contain two keys, "title" and "occupation",
# and the appropriate values. Your function should return a greeting that uses the person's full name,and mentions the person's title.
