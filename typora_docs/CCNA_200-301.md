# OSI MODEL & TCP/IP



**Networking Models** categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards.

**Network Protocols** are sets of rules defining how networking devices and software should work. These protocols are refered to as **Logical** rules, and not physical.



**The OSI Model**

OSI stands for "Open Systems Interconnection", where open means open model. Created by ISO "International standard for Organization."

OSI functions in 7 layers.

7. **Application layer** - Closest to the end client, Interacts with software applications such as web browsers. HTTP and HTTPS are layer 7 protocols. i.e https://cisco.com/

   The Application layer **identifies** and **Synchronizes** communications between end hosts, and uses Encapsulation.

   **Encapsulation** is the process in which data from each layer is added onto a broken down piece of data known as a **Segment** which is added upon as data passes down the OSI stack. The process of **De-encapsulation** is the removal of the appended additional data as it moves back up the stack to the Application layer on the other system.

   **Adjacent-Layer Interaction** is the process of both encapsulation and de-encapsulation.

   **Same-Layer Interaction** is the process of two different systems identifying and synchronizing within the same layer.

6. **Presentation layer** - Translates application formatted data to a format that is ready to be sent over the network.
   - Translates between application formats and network formats.
   - Encrypts data being sent, decrypts data being received.

5. **Session layer** - Controls dialogue (sessions) between the communicating hosts. Establishes, manages, and terminates between  the local application and remote application (Server side).

The upper 3 layers (5, 6, 7) are usually worked on by application developers, and are not usually worked on by network engineers.

4. **Transport layer** - Segments and reassembles data for communication between end host. 
   - Breaks up large pieces of data into **Segments** to be easily sent over the network.
   - Less likely to cause transmission errors if issue arrises.
   - Provides **Host-to-Host** or **End-to-End** communication.
   - During encapsulation, The segmented data is processed and gets an "L4 header".
     - |Data|Layer 4 header ----------- "Segment"

3. **Network layer** - Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks outside the LAN. 

   - Provides **logical Addressing** (IP addresses), path selection between source and destination.
   - Routers operate at layer 3 because they are layer 3 devices.

   As data passes through the the Network layer, a layer 3 header is added.

    - |Data|Layer 4 header|Layer 3 header ------------ "Packet"

2. **Data Link layer** - Provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer. Defines how data is formatted for transmission over physical medium, Such as copper cable electrical signals or wireless radio signals.

   - Switches operate at Layer 2, and use L2 destination data to determine where to send data.

   - |L2 trailer| Data | L4 header | L3 header | L2 header --------- "Frame"
