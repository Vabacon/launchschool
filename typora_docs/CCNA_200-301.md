# OSI MODEL & TCP/IP



**Networking Models** categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards.

**Network Protocols** are sets of rules defining how networking devices and software should work. These protocols are refered to as **Logical** rules, and not physical.



**The OSI Model**

OSI stands for "Open Systems Interconnection", where open means open model. Created by ISO "International standard for Organization."

OSI functions in 7 layers.

7. **Application layer** - Closest to the end client, Interacts with software applications such as web browsers. HTTP and HTTPS are layer 7 protocols. i.e https://cisco.com/

   The Application layer **identifies** and **Synchronizes** communications between end hosts, and uses Encapsulation.

   **Encapsulation** is the process in which data from each layer is added onto a broken down piece of data known as a **Segment** which is added upon as data passes down the OSI stack. The process of **De-encapsulation** is the removal of the appended additional data as it moves back up the stack to the Application layer on the other system.

   **Adjacent-Layer Interaction** is the process of both encapsulation and de-encapsulation.

   **Same-Layer Interaction** is the process of two different systems identifying and synchronizing within the same layer.

6. **Presentation layer** - Translates application formatted data to a format that is ready to be sent over the network.

- Translates between application formats and network formats.
- Encrypts data being sent, decrypts data being received.

5. **Session layer** - Controls dialogue (sessions) between the communicating hosts. Establishes, manages, and terminates between  the local application and remote application (Server side).

The upper 3 layers (5, 6, 7) are usually worked on by application developers, and are not usually worked on by network engineers.

4. **Transport layer** - Segments and reassembles data for communication between end host. 
   - Breaks up large pieces of data into **Segments** to be easily sent over the network.
   - Less likely to cause transmission errors if issue arrises.
   - Provides **Host-to-Host** or **End-to-End** communication.
   - During encapsulation, The segmented data is processed and gets an "L4 header".
     - |Data|Layer 4 header ----------- "Segment"


3. **Network layer** - Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks outside the LAN. 

- Provides **logical Addressing** (IP addresses), path selection between source and destination.
- Routers operate at layer 3 because they are layer 3 devices.

As data passes through the the Network layer, a layer 3 header is added.

 - |Data|Layer 4 header|Layer 3 header ------------ "Packet"

2. **Data Link layer** - Provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer. Defines how data is formatted for transmission over physical medium, Such as copper cable electrical signals or wireless radio signals.

- Switches operate at Layer 2, and use L2 destination data to determine where to send data.
- |L2 trailer| Data | L4 header | L3 header | L2 header --------- "Frame"

1. **Physical layer** - Defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices.

- Determines voltage levels, maximum transmission distances, rates, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc.
- Bits are converted into electrical signals on wired connections, and into radio signals, for wireless connections.
- All the information on physical layers in the **Interfaces and Cables** chapter is related to the physical layer.



**OSI PDUs**

PDU stands for "Protocol Data Units". Is the term given to data as it proceeds through the OSI stack.

- L4 PDU is called a "Segment"
- L3 PDU is called a "Packet"
- L2 PDU is called a "Frame"
- L1 PDU is called a "Bit"

An acronym for these PDUs is "All People Seem To Need Data Processing", for Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.



**TCP/IP**

**Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol** Is a conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet and other networks, that are in use today.

- Developed by the U.S.D.O.D through DARPA, the model contains a similar structure to the OSI model but with **fewer** layers.
- Although TCP/IP is used today in modern networks, OSI still influences how network engineers think and talk about networks.

There are only 4 layers to the TCP/IP.

4. Application = upper 3 layers of the OSI model.

3. Transport = layer 4 "Transport"

2. Internet = layer 3 "Network"

1. Link = Layer 2 and 1 "Data Link" and "Physical"

When referring to a layer, such as "in layer 2", be aware that people may consider layer 2 within the OSI model and not the TCP/IP. So when talking or mentioning a layer, speak in terms of OSI, and specify when talking about TCP/IP.

A network data flow shows encapsulation with host A,

- forwarded to a router over a UTP Ethernet cable, de-encapsulated so that the router can see the layer 3 address, since routers are layer 3 devices. encapsulates the data again, and sent to another router over long distance fiber cabling.
- The next router de-encapsulates the data to see the layer 3 address, encapsulated again, and sent to the router at host B.
- Host B de-encapsulates the data, removed headers at layer 3 and 4, and is finally available to the end client.
